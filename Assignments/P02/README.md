## P01- Golang Youtube Tutorial 
### Delton Hughes 

### Description:

- In this program we set up a directory and a couple of paths. First 
making a folder called `imagemod` next `imageManipulator` which is a 
package essentially making a class. This class manipulates an image 
with a set of functions which allow for multiple use cases of the 
`NewImageManipulatorWithImage`. In the end result the picture will have
a rectangle on the picure.
