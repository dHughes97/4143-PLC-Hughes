## P01- Golang Youtube Tutorial 
### Delton Hughes 

### Description:

- In this program we set up our programming environment in VSCode with 
Golang. We then made a small program, using init to create a `go.mod` file.
Next, we made our own package and imported said package into the `main.go`
file. The end result ended in Tux by using a `PrintLn()` function and the 
`BestMascot()` function we imported.

### Instructions
 To run program the user must cd into the P01 program folder to be able to use 
 run commands in the terminal. After this is done the user will type `go run main.go`. 
 This will print out the string `Tux` in the terminal. 

### Example Commands
```
//Need to cd into the correct folder first look for correct folder. 
$ ls            //this will list the folders where you are located 
$ cd assignments //to go into the according folder 
$ ls 
$ cd P01 //brings you to the folder with the program we need to run.
```
